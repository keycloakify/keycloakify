<h1><a href="#">Keycloakify </a> Storybook</h1>

<p>
This website showcases all the Keycloak user-facing pages that can be customized using Keycloakify.
The storybook serves as a comprehensive reference to help you determine which pages you would like to personalize.
Keep in mind that customizing the <code>Template</code> component alone will already cover 90% of your customization needs.
</p>

<p>
If you discover that a page you wish to customize is not currently supported by Keycloakify, don't worry. 
Simply refer to <a href="https://docs.keycloakify.dev/limitations#i-have-established-that-a-page-that-i-need-isnt-supported-out-of-the-box-by-keycloakify-now-what">this documentation page</a> for further assistance.
